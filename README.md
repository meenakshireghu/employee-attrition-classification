# Employee Attrition Classification
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition based on a Kaggle dataset. By applying various models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and AdaBoost, the goal is to accurately classify employees at risk of leaving based on key attributes.
## Project Overview
The project utilizes Kaggleâ€™s Employee Attrition dataset and applies various machine learning algorithms to predict whether an employee will leave the company. The main techniques used in this project include:

- **Predictive Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and AdaBoost Classifier.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV was applied to tune the Random Forest and SVM models for optimal performance.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the feature space and improve the performance of the models.
- **Model Comparison:** Multiple models were compared to evaluate their accuracy.

## Model Performance

The following models were trained and evaluated:

| Model                  | Accuracy Score  | Methodology               |
|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 0.903790        | Base Model                |
